;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package brings soccer (football) fixtures, results, table in your Emacs.
;; Currently it works for
;;
;; 1. Premier League (England)
;; 2. La Liga (Spain)
;; 3. Ligue 1 (France)
;;
;; Other leagues could be easily included and would be in future.
;;
;; To get the time of kick off in your local time, you may want to set the
;; following value accordingly
;;
;; (setq soccer-time-local-time-utc-offset "+0530") ;; this should be changed to your local one
;;
;; Common Functions:
;;
;; This package comes with handy interactive functions to get useful information in your minibuffer.
;; To invoke a function use "M-x Function" where Function could be any of the following functions
;;
;; Functions	                Actions
;; soccer-fixtures-next	Fixture for the Next match
;; soccer-fixtures-next-5	Fixtures of the Next 5 matches
;; soccer-fixtures-full-in-org	Full fixtures saved in org file
;; soccer-fixtures-all-clubs    Fixtures for all clubs in a league
;; soccer-results-last	        Result of the last match
;; soccer-results-last-5	Results of the last 5 matches
;; soccer-results-full-in-org	Full list of results in org file
;; soccer-results-all-clubs     Results for all clubs in a league
;; soccer-table                 Full Ranking table
;; soccer-table-top-4           Ranking table with top 4 teams
;; soccer-table-bottom-4        Ranking table with bottom 4 teams
;; soccer-scorecard             Scorecard of a match
